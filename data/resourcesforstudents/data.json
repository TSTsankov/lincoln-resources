Although Smith (2004) argues\nthat 48% of children prefer to play inside, Jones (1964) found that\n98% of children in Britain prefer to play outdoors. I spoke to some\nparents in Rochborough who said their children missed out by\nnot being able to play down by the river or roam the countryside\nin safety. Most children are now television addicts, or, worse, are\naddicted to computer games. Everybody knows that this is\ndamaging children educationally, and yet nothing is done about it.<p><p>\nThis is certainly true of Rochborough’s children, and the main\nreason is that they do not have anywhere to play. Hardly anybody\nin Rochborough has a garden. It would be better for their health if\nthey played outdoors, but parents say they won’t let them unless\nsupervised play areas are provided. The parents are worried that\nthey cannot see their children when they are playing. What chance\nis there for the health of citizens in Rochborough if its children do\nnot get to play outdoors, and end up as TV addicts?"

                                "text": "<i>THE PERSONAL QUALITIES OF A TEACHER\n<p><p>\nHere I want to try to give you an answer to the question: What\npersonal qualities are desirable in a teacher? Probably no two\npeople would draw up exactly similar lists, but I think the\nfollowing would be generally accepted.</i>\n<p><p>\n<i>First, the teacher's personality should be pleasantly live and\nattractive. This does not rule out people who are physically plain,\nor even ugly, because many such have great personal charm. But\nit does rule out such types as the over-excitable, melancholy,\nfrigid, sarcastic, cynical, frustrated, and over-bearing : I would\nsay too, that it excludes all of dull or purely negative personality.\nI still stick to what I said in my earlier book: that school children\nprobably 'suffer more from bores than from brutes'.<p><p>\nSecondly, it is not merely desirable but essential for a teacher to\nhave a genuine capacity for sympathy - in the literal meaning of\nthat word; a capacity to tune in to the minds and feelings of\nother people, especially, since most teachers are school teachers,\nto the minds and feelings of children. Closely related with this is\nthe capacity to be tolerant - not, indeed, of what is wrong, but of\nthe frailty and immaturity of human nature which induce people,\nand again especially children, to make mistakes.<p><p>\n<i>Thirdly, I hold it essential for a teacher to be both intellectually\nand morally honest. This does not mean being a plaster saint. It\nmeans that he will be aware of his intellectual strengths, and\nlimitations, and will have thought about and decided upon the\nmoral principles by which his life shall be guided. There is no\ncontradiction in my going on to say that a teacher should be a bit\nof an actor. That is part of the technique of teaching, which\ndemands that every now and then a teacher should be able to put\non an act - to enliven a lesson, correct a fault, or award praise.\nChildren, especially young children, live in a world that is rather\nlarger than life.<p><p>\nA teacher must remain mentally alert. He will not get into the\nprofession if of low intelligence, but it is all too easy, even for\npeople of above-average intelligence, to stagnate intellectually -\nand that means to deteriorate intellectually. A teacher must be\nquick to adapt himself to any situation, however improbable and\nable to improvise, if necessary at less than a moment's notice.\n(Here I should stress that I use 'he' and 'his' throughout the book\nsimply as a matter of convention and convenience.)<p><p>\nOn the other hand, a teacher must be capable of infinite\npatience. This, I may say, is largely a matter of self-discipline and\nself-training; we are none of us born like that. He must be pretty\nresilient; teaching makes great demands on nervous energy. And\nhe should be able to take in his stride the innumerable petty\nirritations any adult dealing with children has to endure.<p><p>\nFinally, I think a teacher should have the kind of mind which\nalways wants to go on learning. Teaching is a job at which one\nwill never be perfect; there is always something more to learn\nabout it. There are three principal objects of study: the subject,\nor subjects, which the teacher is teaching; the methods by which\nthey can best be taught to the particular pupils in the classes he\nis teaching; and - by far the most important - the children, young\npeople, or adults to whom they are to be taught. The two cardinal\nprinciples of British education today are that education is\neducation of the whole person, and that it is best acquired\nthrough full and active co-operation between two persons, the\nteacher and the learner. </i>\n<p>(From Teaching as a Career, by H. C.\nDent, Batsford, 1961)"
