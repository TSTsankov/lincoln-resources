Students and educators/mentors share responsibility for learning. The educator/mentor is tasked with creating learning opportunities for the students as part of their primary role of delivering effective healthcare. The student is expected to have developed the theoretical knowledge necessary to engage with the learning and take responsibility for speaking to the educator about what is within their scope of practice. The complexity of challenging the student appropriately and supporting different learning styles is compounded by the workload.",
