Sarah allows Paul to express his concerns and questions him to find out whether he is actually behind with his course and what reasons he believes there are for this. As the conversation develops, it becomes clear to Sarah that Paul isn't actually too far behind with his work but that his recent unexpected poor exam results has knocked his confidence down. Sarah steers the conversation more towards Paul's strengths and enbales him to explore the potential actions he could take to regain his confidence and get 'back on track'.

She explores with each student how they are feeling and encourages them to discuss what issues they are facing both within and outside of the college. Sarah asks questions and challenges students to think about and express their issues a bit more deeply than they might normally, whilst providing encouragement and guidance if needed. Her main aim is to give the students a change to look at themselves more closely, to explore new ideas and help build their confidence. She encourages the student to take the initiative and any actions resulting from the meeting that contribute to their learning and progress remains their responsibility. She helps them to think about potential outcomes of the actions in more detail and how long they think it would take for them to show progress. Sarah has found working with her students one to one is rewarding and a welcome change from regular class delivery. She has discovered that the students tend to behave differently than when in a normal classroom or corridor environment and that she is looking forward to this aspect of her role.\n</span>",
